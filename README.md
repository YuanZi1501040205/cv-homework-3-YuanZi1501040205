See Homework - 3 description file (Homework-3.pdf) for details.

Assignment steps:
1.	Create a training dataset.
    Upload your code for extracting positive/negative sanmples 
2.	Train a cascade classifier using Haar and LBP features.
    Upload your final cascade classifier (.xml) for each
    Do not upload your training data
3.  Car Detection: Use the classifier(s) to detect cars in a test image.     
    Upload your code for detecting cars using the trained cascade classifier(s)
4.	Parking spot analysis application: Use the detected cars to decide if a parking spot is empty.
    Upload your code for detecting the number of parking spots that are empty.
5.  Report:
    Upload your report.
    
Please see assignment and report details in the homework description file (Homework-3.pdf).
    
1. Create dataset                         - 3 Pts.
2. Cascade classifier training            - 3 Pts.
3. Car Detection                          - 3 Pts
4. Parking spot analysis application      - 3 Pts
5. Report                                 - 3 Pts

    Total                                 - 15 Pts.
    
Note. The training and testing can take unusually long time. Please start ahead of the due date
